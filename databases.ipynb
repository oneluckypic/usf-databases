    "# Overview of Databases\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a systematic manner. \n",
    "It is designed to efficiently manage, retrieve, and manipulate large amounts of data with integrity and reliability. \n",
    "Databases are designed to store large quantities of data and in practice will be served from a remote server either internal to your company or hosted on the cloud.\n",
    "## Structured Query Language (SQL) Databases\n",
    "SQL databases follow a row and column structure to build tables of data which can be manipulated by various operations. The data format is meant to be rigid (i.e. structured) to ensure that a wide variety of operations (e.g. merges, joins) can be performed on the data.\n",
    "## No-SQL Databases\n",
    "Since SQL databases are widely used and known, anything else is referred to No-SQL databases. These include document databases which simply store a key tied to a document, or hierarchical databases which are optimized for fast search and others.\n",
    "## Today's Examples Use ElephantSQL\n",
    "Today's examples will use a cloud PostgreSQL service, ElephantSQL to interact with a live hosted Postgresql database. Postgresql is the successor to a database called Ingress, both developed at Berkeley. Today it is one of the most advanced open source rational databases available, according to its website. We will execute Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations along with examples of transaction and error handling.\n",
